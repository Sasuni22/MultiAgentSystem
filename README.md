The Bookstore Multi-Agent Simulation System is a Python-based interactive simulation developed using Streamlit, Owlready2, and Matplotlib. It models a smart bookstore environment where multiple agents, including Customers and Employees, interact autonomously. The system uses ontology-driven knowledge representation and conceptual SWRL rules to define relationships and logical behaviors. Customers purchase books, reducing stock levels, while employees automatically restock items when quantities fall below a threshold. The Streamlit interface allows users to control simulation parameters such as the number of customers, employees, and simulation steps, providing a clear and professional visualization of results through a compact line graph. At the end of each run, the final inventory, customer purchases, and ontology updates are displayed, and results are saved in an OWL file. This project demonstrates how ontology reasoning and agent-based modeling can be combined to simulate real-world decision-making and automate processes in a bookstore environment.
